# Animx
An application to search for anime, like a Imdb or Crunchyroll. 
I create it for learning purposes.
Right now in progress.


## About
In general, the application is a search for anime by topics, the ability to add something to your list, view the trailer, description and ratings, as well as search for new ones and notification of new series and release date.
